## Future features

  - **Reservations**
  Currently the reservations app can only take one table at a time, the posibility of joining tables and store them in database would make the app a real world and efficient application.

  - **Reviews**
  Could have a review section linked to tripadvisor or to open table from where potential customers could check people's opinions out easily from the website.

  - **Menus Examples**
  Menus examples could be displayed in a seperated pdf window from which interested users could print them out.

  - **User account**
  In case the company had some other venues, users could have a private account from which check and manage reservations from one single website and receive deals or news from them.
